# AI-project--Inferring-Characteristic-Traits-of-An-author-given-his-or-her-work
This   project   presents   a   method   to   predict   the   characteristic   traits   of   an   author   of   a   given   book.   Characteristic   traits   -   like   gender,   race,   age   of   the   author   at   the   time   of   publishing,   the   genre   of   the   book,   and   other   socioeconomic   and   psychological   factors   -   which   in uence   the   content   and   style   of   writing   of   an   author   can   be   predicted   given   his/her   work.   Multiple   feature   vectors(tf-idf,   n-gram,   POS   tagging)   were   extracted   from   texts   using   preprocessing   techniques   (stopword   removal,   stemming,   lemmatization)   and   a   comparative   performance   study   for   every   technique   was   analyzed   by   applying   six   classi cation   methods   (namely   Na√Øve   Bayes,   SVM   using   gradient   descent,   k-NN,   Random   Forest,   Passive   Aggressive,   Perceptron).   These   analytic   studies   were   performed   with   the   aid   of   the   sklearn   machine   learning   library   and   the   Natural   Language   Toolkit.   The   performance   of   the   classi ers   was   further   compared   for   data   with   and   without preprocessing.
